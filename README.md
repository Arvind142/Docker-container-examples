# Docker-Container-Examples
Hello Users,
	I've create few .sh(shell) files which could help you run few of popular docker images successfully with bare minium configuration.

### Images used for example:
1. SonarQube
2. PhpMyAdmin
3. Mysql
4. mongo
5. mongo-express
6. wordpress

### What is added till now?
I've used few image combination like:
1. **Mysql** with **PhpMyAdmin**
3. **Wordpress** with **mysql** db as backend and **phpmyadmin** as UI for mysql db and wordpress with which you can create your own website faster.
4. **Mongo** db as backend and **Mongo-Express** as frondend with which user can work with mongo db.
5. **SonarQube** for code quality check where user gets an UI check code analysis and quality.

	More such examples and combination on the way...
